# The sieve of Eratosthenes
Sieve of Eratosthenes (algorithm to find prime numbers) in different programming languages.

This project is inspired by [99 Bottles of Beer](http://99-bottles-of-beer.net/) (a collection of the song "99 Bottles of Beer" programmed in different programming languages).

Come and join me and add a version of another programming language which is missing, or add another (maybe better) implementation of already existing code (but do not overwrite existing code, just create a new file). Just clone the project, create the code you would like to see and create a pull request, I will review it and if it works and looks good I will merge it.

## Clone & run locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Amarok24/eratosthenes-sieve.git
