# The sieve of Eratosthenes
Sieve of Eratosthenes (algorithm to find prime numbers) in different programming languages.

This is a community project, come and join me and add the version of another programming language to this project which is missing, or add another (maybe better) implementation of already existing code (but do not overwrite existing code, just create a new file).

Just clone the project, create the code you would like to see and create a pull request, I will review it and if it works and looks good I will merge it.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Amarok24/eratosthenes-sieve.git

cd eratosthenes-sieve
```
